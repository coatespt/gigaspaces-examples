This is an example of how to run services co-located with space nodes.
It consists of a simple worker and a stand-alone feeder.

To build the example:

    1.  Set the JSHOMEDIR environment variable to the GigaSpaces
        installation directory.
    2.  Run 'ant build' in the base directory.

To run the example:

    1.  Modify the bin/gs-setup.sh script to reflect the correct
        GigaSpaces installation directory.
    2.  Modify the bin/start-infrastructure.sh script to specify the
        desired number of Grid Service Containers to run.
    3.  Run bin/start-infrastructure.sh.
    4.  Modify the bin/deploy.sh script to specify the desired
        GigaSpaces topology.
    5.  Deploy the example with bin/deploy.sh.
    6.  Run the feeder with bin/feed.sh.
        By default this will write a total of 100,000 request objects
        one at a time from five threads.

To monitor the run, start the GigaSpaces GUI with bin/start-ui.sh.

To demonstrate scalability, deploy on different sized clusters and
compare the results.

This is an example of how to invoke a remote service running in a
distributed space. It consists of a simple remote service and a
stand-alone caller.

To build the example:

    1.  Set the JSHOMEDIR environment variable to the GigaSpaces
        installation directory.
    2.  Run 'ant build' in the base directory.

To run the example:

    1.  Modify the bin/gs-setup.sh script to reflect the correct
        GigaSpaces installation directory.
    2.  Modify the bin/start-infrastructure.sh script to specify the
        desired number of Grid Service Containers to run.
    3.  Run bin/start-infrastructure.sh.
    4.  Modify the bin/deploy.sh script to specify the desired
        GigaSpaces topology.
    5.  Deploy the example with bin/deploy.sh.
    6.  Run the caller with bin/call.sh.

To monitor the run, start the GigaSpaces GUI with bin/start-ui.sh.

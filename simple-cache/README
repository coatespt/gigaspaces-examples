This is an example of how to use GigaSpaces as a simple cache.  It is
probably the simplest possible working GigaSpaces configuration.  When
run, the Cacher class writes some Swag objects into the space,
retrieves them by ID, and then removes them by ID.

This example uses only the simplest write(), read(), and take()
methods of the GigaSpace interface.  The readById(), takeById(), and
any of the *Multiple() methods would be more efficient.

The Swag.gs.xml file is used instead of annotations to configure the
Swag class to be written to and read from the space.  An example of
using annotations is in the file Swag.java.annotated.  The choice of
which approach to use is up to each project's coding standards.

To build the example:

    1.  Set the JSHOMEDIR environment variable to the GigaSpaces
        installation directory.
    2.  Run 'ant build' in the base directory.

To run the example:

    1.  Modify the bin/gs-setup.sh script to reflect the correct
        GigaSpaces installation directory.
    2.  Modify the bin/start-infrastructure.sh script to specify the
        desired number of Grid Service Containers to run.
    3.  Run bin/start-infrastructure.sh.
    4.  Modify the bin/deploy.sh script to specify the desired
        GigaSpaces topology.
    5.  Deploy the example with bin/deploy.sh.
    6.  Run the cacher with bin/cache.sh.
        By default this will write, retrieve, and remove 100 Swag
        objects to and from the space.

To monitor the run, start the GigaSpaces GUI with bin/start-ui.sh.

To demonstrate scalability, deploy on different sized clusters or with
additional workers spread over more machines and compare the results.
